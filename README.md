 1. Download and install an extension "Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin"
 
 i. What is Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin addon?

This addon lets you easily perform cross-domain ajax request in web applications. Simply activate the addon and perform the request. CORS or cross origin resource sharing is blocked (in javascript APIs) in modern browsers by default. Installing this addon will allow you to unblock this feature. Please note that, when the addon is added to your browser, it is inactive by default (toolbar icon is big grey C). If you want to activate the addon, please press on the toolbar icon once. The icon will turn to big orange C letter.

ii. What is CORS?

As mentioned above, Cross Origin Resource Sharing or CORS is a policy that let the browser gain permission to access resources from a server on a different domain. Different domain means, a domain different than the top domain which the website is using. For example, if a page is in domain-1.com, and wants to make an image request from domain-2.com, this is called CORS request. Modern browser understand CORS policy and does not allow cross-origin resource sharing once the server requests that. When you have this addon active, CORS is always allowed for all websites, no matter what the server requests for.
